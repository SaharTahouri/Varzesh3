# Varzesh3 main page clone
This project is a clone of Varzesh3's 2024 version of website. I've used Bootstrap classes as far as they were implementable and added custom styles using Sass when needed. I also used Json for storing and organizing the data and then fetched them.
The sliders are coded using Bootstrap's carousel classes. The filtering systems all work properly and you can also switch between tabs.
I've used "Persian Date" library for real-time Persian date and time.
